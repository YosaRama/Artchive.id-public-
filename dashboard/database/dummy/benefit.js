      "Art is one of the masterpieces on this earth because every single piece of art has a deep meaning. Indonesia has many talented artists because Indonesia has a lot of types of culture. The gallery is one of the media used by art workers to exhibit their works of art. Unfortunately, in Indonesia, access to exhibit paintings in galleries is limited and access to visit galleries is also limited, but artworks in Indonesia do not get good attention.
